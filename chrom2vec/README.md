## Setup

1. Singularity installation. We use singularity to containerize every preprocessing step.
```bash
conda create -n chromnitron
conda activate chromnitron

conda install python==3.9 pyyaml==6.0.2
conda install conda-forge::singularity
```

2. Download all containers. The default storage location is `~/.singularity/cache/`
```bash
bash Chrom2VecModules/setup/download_images.sh
```

## Running Pipeline
1. Configure the `config.yaml` file to specify input fastq file and output locations. 
2. To execute pipeline, run 
```
python main.py config.yaml
```
3. For inference with Chromnitron, softlink (`ln -s `) the normalized zarr file to ATAC-seq directory with a **specified condition name** (`ln -s <path-to-output>s8_normalized/genrich_normalized.zarr <<path-to-chromnitron_resource>/input_resources/ATAC-seq/<condition-name>.zarr`). 
4. During inference setup, add the condition name to `celltype.txt` to enable inference on custom ATAC-seq generated here.

## Batch SRR Pipeline (download + run + keep s8)
1. Edit `chrom2vec/src/srr_list.txt` (one SRR ID per line).
2. Update `chrom2vec/src/batch_config.yaml` once for your paths and resources.
3. Run:
```
python chrom2vec/src/batch_run.py chrom2vec/src/batch_config.yaml
```
This will download each SRR with `prefetch` + `fasterq-dump`, run chrom2vec, skip s9, keep only s8 outputs, and delete raw FASTQ/SRA if enabled in `batch_config`. To avoid conflicts with an older system `prefetch`, set `batch_config.download_use_singularity: true` and provide `download_singularity_image` (local `.sif` or `docker://` URI).

## Notes: additional data downloads on the first run
The pipeline will automatically download a few files on the first run. In case some links are broken, here is a list of all files that you can manually check and download:
1. Hisat2 alignment index: `https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/hisat/${ASSEMBLY}_genome.tar.gz`
2. cPeaks (hg38): `https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/6eb530748b324f53bc1f/?dl=1` # Very likely to change in the future
3. chr_sizes (hg38): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igvteam/igv/master/genomes/sizes/hg38.chrom.sizes`
